Overall Project Goals: 


PHASE 1 :

Create a project to demonstrating the asynchronous capabilities of django,
through the ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface).

It will use the django channels package, and follow this package official tutorial example.
Daphne will be used as the ASGI compatible application server and Docker for the containerization. 

2 Docker containers will be created, 1 python:alpine based to run django and its dependencies,
the second container will run the redis:alpine service used in the example.
Those containers will initially be created independantly, and connected through a manual docker network configuration.

Once proper demonstration of the ASGI, PHASE 1 COMPLETED

PHASE 2 :

Refactoring of the containerization code into docker compose file.
Experimentation with service start chronology control (depends_on, healthchek parameters and further ...)

Upon successfull implementation of the docker compose refactor and successfull control of service start up process, PHASE 2 COMPLETED


Short term course of action :

- create python:alpine container
- install python and project dependencies
- Complete django channels tutorial part 1 ( implementation of Daphne server )
